    <h2>Northern California</h2>
     <p>My favorite stop in Northern California was Mount Shasta. There was a great (but expensive) burger place called Yak's, which was the only thing I ate for the two days I stayed there.The scenery was beautiful, yet deserted of people. All the stores looked like a barren Costco during the pandemic.<br>Other than expensive burgers, I had a near-death experience where I  went mountainbiking in Lake Siskiyou with a regular street bike. I got lost in the forest, fell into a ditch, and still had to trek about 15 miles back to the hotel room. I still have the scars from falling into a ditch 3 months ago, but it was a memorable experience. I think everyone should get lost in the woods at least once in their life just for experience.<br> We also stopped by Sacramento to visit family friends and say hi to my uncle. My family friends also have a goldendoodle like my family, so we were excited for them to meet. Unfortunately, my dog was too homesick to be nice and now they're arch nemesis.</p>

    <h2>Oregon</h2>
    <p>On the way to Washington, we first stopped at Bend. By far it is my favorite place in America. I went mountainbiking there and also drove out to see Crater Lake, which was still snowing in the middle of the summer.The only thing I brang on this roadtrip were tanktops and shorts so I was freezing.<br>On the way back home, I stopped at Tillamook to eat cheese and ice cream (even though I'm lactose intolerant). Tillamook is this rural city by the ocean. It was super duper cold and everyhwere I went was overemployed with bored teenagers with nothing else to do. It was beautiful, though.</p>

  <h2>Washington</h2>
     <p>My dad's side of the family lives there so I visit every year, sometimes several times a year. I know my way around the Seattle area pretty well. I also know that Pike's place is a tourist trap because a lot of the vendors try to rip me off with low-quality goods. Washington was the final destination on the roadtrip. I stay at my aunt's place for four days and basically just looked for hiking spots. My favorite hiking spots was the Ice Caves because it was really cool and mysterious that there was just a huge mountain of ice that carries a bunch of horror stories about people who got lost in the caves. I also flew up there a month later with my sister to attend my cousin's wedding. Out of all the trips to Washington, that was my favorite trip.</p>
